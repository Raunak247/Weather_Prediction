## 🧠 Project Overview

This project merges **machine learning, deep learning**, and **data visualization** to solve the real-world challenge of weather and environmental forecasting. It leverages:

- **LSTM models** for multivariate **time series forecasting** (AQI, temperature, humidity).
- **(Optional Vision Module)** CNN for classifying weather conditions using **image data**.
- **Power BI dashboards** for highly interactive **analytical exploration**, covering geospatial mapping, trends, KPIs, and Python-powered insights.

It is a **hybrid model-driven and analytical project** tailored for actionable environmental intelligence and decision support.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Accurately **predict future AQI, temperature, and humidity** using past observations.
- Visually analyze **city-level environmental data** to identify trends, outliers, and hotspots.
- Enable **non-technical users** to explore environmental metrics using dashboards.
- Integrate **Python scripting within Power BI** to enable forecasting and deeper insights.

🧠 Development Philosophy
🧠 Note on Development Approach:
This project is designed as a No-Code AI Solution. While the core logic and models were developed using tools like Jupyter, Power BI, and pre-built libraries, all decisions regarding data preprocessing, model design, forecasting logic, visual storytelling, and workflow integration were conceptualized and orchestrated by me.

The goal was to demonstrate the power of AI-assisted development, focusing on high-level problem solving and system design, rather than manual low-level coding. It showcases how impactful solutions can be built by combining the strengths of modern AI tools and a human-driven vision.

🚀 Future Scope
Real-time weather APIs

CNN integration

Mobile app or web deployment

API-enabled dashboards

IoT data pipeline
